## Strong Wooden Pickaxe

A mod to make mining easier, but still respect pickaxe progression.

Strong wooden pickaxe is just a faster wooden pickaxe (diamond pickaxe fast). It cannot mine stone containing iron ore, so you still need stone pickaxe. The durabilty is set to mine around 100 stone.

To craft this pickaxe, you need 2 strong sticks and 3 woods. Strong sticks can be crafted using 3 sticks.

Alternative to Shallow ore.
